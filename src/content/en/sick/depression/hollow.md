When children fall, they get back up on their own,<br/>
like moving forward is our instinct.<br/>
Their mums will encourage them to keep moving forward<br/>
like moving forward is meaningful in itself.<br/>

But,<br/>

Will we consider studying as meaningful?<br/>
No, as studying is to solve problems:<br/>
Studying serves the purpose of improving our lives and the world.<br/>

Will we consider working as meaningful?<br/>
No, as working is to make a living:<br/>
Working serves the purpose of supporting themselves and their families.<br/>

Children run around because of excitement and curiosity.<br/>

We move forward to see the harvest day.<br/>

> He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.

If you fall while moving forward,<br/>
is it another challenge to overcome,<br/>
or is it indicating that you should give up?<br/>

It is a pity that no one can peek into the future.<br/>
Only by moving forward can we evaluate whether we should have moved forward.<br/>

> Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.

> \- [Søren Kierkegaard](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6812-life-can-only-be-understood-backwards-but-it-must-be)

Time is the strongest force in this universe:<br/>
time flies when we are happy;<br/>
time becomes the hardest thing to kill when we are bored.<br/>

But people who have lost hope for the future are stronger than time:<br/>
Whether time is moving fast or slow matters none to them.<br/>
Time moves forward, but they move on to nowhere.<br/>
