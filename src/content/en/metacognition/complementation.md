The world often presents itself as dualities:
right versus wrong, good versus bad, correct versus incorrect, and so on.

Do you agree?

Can you think of a counterexample?

Yes or no? Perhaps? What do you mean exactly?

This is a simple exercise, highlighting an fundamental limitation for language:
it often struggles to capture the nuances of experience.

For instance, between black and white lies a "gray area".
Judging people as wholly good or bad is difficult.
Even determining whether something is right or wrong can be debatable.

Some call these indescribable aspects of experience "common sense" or a "sixth sense".
The older generation often share them as life advice.
Ancient wisdom echoes this sentiment, saying: "the Dao (the way) that can be spoken is not the typical Dao".

For friends who have known each other for a long time,
a simple gesture or glance can convey volumes, needing no words at all.

Language serves as a medium for our thoughts, but it shouldn't be a constraint.
To liberate our thinking, we need to move beyond recognizable concepts.

Do you know that combining different concepts can lead to unexpected breakthroughs, much like a chemical reaction?

Art and science, though often perceived as distinct disciplines, are fundamentally related.

Artists orchestrate sensory experiences, striving to capture beauty in their work.
This requires mastering the manipulation of materials to showcase their most compelling qualities.

A magnificent idea, lacking a medium to express it, will ultimately remain unrealized.

Engineers utilize natural laws to develop tools that address specific problems.
This requires a nuanced understanding of user interaction, ensuring that tools are intuitive and facilitate seamless engagement.

State-of-the-art inventions are rendered ineffective if they fail to align with user expectations and established patterns of perception.

Artworks can be engineering marvels; tools can be aesthetic.

We often compartmentalize our minds, describing ourselves as "emotional" or "rational" people.
However, in reality, no one is exclusively one or the other.

Pay attention, and you'll begin to see that both sides coexist within us.

Samurai Champloo is the animation that has influenced me the most.

It blends a variety of narrative techniques and unique cultural elements,
while showcasing distinguishable styles of illustration and music.
I was amazed at how an animation could combine all these elements so seamlessly and still tell a fun, cohesive story.

I particularly remember a piece of dialogue:

"You must learn to make use of your intellect in the martial arts.
By relying solely upon instinct and reflex,
you involuntarily reveal your limitations to your enemy."

The protagonist, who always relied on brute force,
was outmaneuvered and defeated within a few moves by a wise martial artist.

I immediately resonated with the quote,
realizing it applied directly to how I should approach my League of Legends games.

When I first started learning new characters, it was a chaotic dance of instinct.
I'm not sure what I was doing, just reacting, throwing out moves based on gut feeling.
Surprisingly, sometimes that led to unexpected outplays.

But when I tried to replicate those moments,
my opponents seemed to anticipate my every move, punishing my attempts.

I then began to refine the combos,
slowly piecing together a deeper understanding of each character's strengths and limitations.

Successfully landing a complex combo felt exhilarating,
but a single misstep often resulted in a humiliating defeat.

Eventually, I realized I was overthinking it.
I stepped back, silenced the analytical voice in my head,
and returned to relying on that initial instinct,
focusing on making the greediest, yet safest, decisions in the moment.

It was an astonishing shift.
I found myself becoming less impulsive, dying less frequently,
and consistently making more impactful plays.

It's clear: you need fast reflexes and quick decision-making to out-micro your opponents.
But equally vital is a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the game to out-macro them.

Only those who acquire both can truly overcome any challenge and emerge victorious.

Perhaps you would like to explore "guided meditation".

The common instruction is "not to think about anything", which I find counterproductive,
similar to how difficult it is to sleep when you keep thinking "I need to sleep".

I believe a more appropriate description is "to ignore both your emotional and rational sides".

Ignore thoughts like "it is boring", "I want to sleep", "I am hungry",
"what should I do later", or "what is my neighbor doing".

Focus solely on the present.

Sit still, close your eyes, listen to your breath,
hear the sounds of children playing outside, or cars driving by.

Learn to stop letting words blind your inner vision.

Start observing the world with your heart.
