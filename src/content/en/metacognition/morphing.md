Since graduating and entering the workforce,
my life has settled into a predictable rhythm: work, eat, sleep, and repeat.

Honestly, I find it quite comfortable -
it eliminates the hassle of making unnecessary decisions.
However, I can't accept stagnation; I'm hungry for knowledge.

During casual conversations with colleagues, the topic of vacations inevitably arises.
They usually talk about their travels, and I often have to respond by saying I haven't been anywhere.
They always encourage me to travel, see the world, and take a break from work.

But deep down, I'm a homebody;
the idea of extensive travel doesn't particularly appeal to me.
My comfort zone is being in front of my computer all day.

Still, I don't want to feel out of touch with the world.

So I explore YouTube, watching people share their experiences or teaching about all sorts of things.
I also use X to keep up with current news and discover trending, useful IT tools to improve my daily workflow.

Sometimes I wonder if I'm just stubborn and adapt to change too slowly.

The thought of being in a situation I'd never imagined, completely unprepared, is unsettling.

As a kid, I dreaded writing exercises.
I'd stare at the assignment until dawn - sometimes until 2 or 3 a.m. - without writing a single word.

When organizing school events, I'd sit there, paralyzed, struggling to come up with game ideas.
I'm not even someone who enjoys playing games myself, so contributing felt particularly difficult.

I've been challenging myself recently to learn new programming languages.
I really wish I could learn Elixir, OCaml, and Clojure,
but learning them is tough because they require a different mindset compared to the imperative languages I'm used to.

Yet, sometimes I crave something new, something beyond my comfort zone.

Some people talk in a way that feels like an oral exam - so formal and rigid, as if following a prescribed script.
It's just boring to talk to them.

When I play drums, I don't like to read sheet music,
partly because I can't play or memorize them,
but mostly because I feel I can better accompany the song by feeling the rhythm myself.

I like to wander around when I'm feeling down,
exploring routes I usually take by transportation.

It seems no one can endure having every day be exactly the same,
but equally, no one can handle radical changes every day.

We can only adapt to changes incrementally.

A common New Year's wish is, "I want to become someone".
We often crave change, imagining ourselves instantly becoming a better version.
But no one can completely transform overnight.
These wishes often feel like fantasies.

Instead, focus on consistent, small improvements over a longer period — a month or a year —
and you're likely to be amazed by how much you'll have changed,
perhaps even more than you can imagine right now.

Changes can also seem daunting and overwhelming.
I used to feel the same way. It is comfortable sticking with what you know.
Forcing yourself to change habits often leads to extra effort and frustration.
But my experience has taught me that venturing outside your comfort zone can sometimes reveal ways of doing things that save time and energy.

Change is, at its core, an exploration of the unknown.
While it can be discouraging, it also holds the potential for rewarding discoveries.
Only those who are willing to take risks and survive can transform themselves and evolve into better versions of themselves.

Some of my friends gamble,
but their behavior doesn't align with the problematic stereotype of someone chasing thrills without considering the consequences.
They're detail-minded and observant, often saying they're minimizing losses and making moves based on probabilities.

Risk-taking can be calculated, strategic moves.

Perhaps this approach applies to personal growth as well.
By carefully managing risks, we can benefit from every step we take.

You don't always have to put yourself into do-or-die situations,
forcing yourself to go all-in and preparing to disappear from everyone else's life if things go wrong.
It can be surprisingly easy - just pick the smallest, most manageable change you can make.

For example, I'm physically unfit,
so I force myself to walk the long staircase on my way home and do some push-ups afterward,
perhaps 20, or 15 if I can't manage, or even just 10.
The goal is to make it so easy that not doing it would feel almost shameful.

It's amazing how much can change when you consistently do something seemingly small.
Great things are accomplished by countless tiny steps.

If you're ready to change, the very first thing to change is your mindset.
Beyond thinking long-term, you also need to embrace mistakes.

Some people, when they make mistakes,
don't reflect on what went wrong or how to correct it.
Instead, they try to cover them up, hoping to maintain a facade of normalcy.
Unfortunately, this kind of mindset ultimately harms them.
The mistakes we've made may resurface later.
Only by learning from past experiences can we improve and avoid repeating those mistakes.

If you can accept mistakes while managing risks well, you are capable to try whatever you want.
Just apologize to your mistakes and then move on as if nothing happened.
This may seem shameful to some, but it is actually the fastest way to learn anything.

Throughout history, there are numerous examples of ancient emperors losing their thrones and lives due to complacency.
We, standing on the shoulders of giants, should learn from these past failures.

The anime Dragon Ball embodies the philosophy of "what doesn't kill me makes me stronger".
Goku even utilizes this setting, deliberately weakening himself and then using a Senzu Bean to fully recover, instantly gaining power from nowhere.

Bruce Lee famously advised us to "be water",
striving to defeat opponents with lightning speed and dedicating a lifetime to training to become formless.

I know a book exploring the concept of "Antifragile",
which argues that the opposite of fragility isn't rigidity, but rather becoming stronger when stressed.
Antifragile systems can withstand shocks and even adapt by changing their structure in response to external interference.

While we are naturally resistant to change,
only those who bravely embrace it will keep pace with the ever-changing world and stay ahead of the curve.
