(inspired by the anime Gurren Lagann)

When you're lost, simply keep moving forward. \
When you reach a dead end, forge a new path with sheer determination. \
When doubt creeps in, remember those you are protecting. \
When you feel alone, "believe in the you who believes in yourself".

> If you really want to do something, you'll find a way.

No matter how long the road, it has an end. \
Reckless aggression will only shatter the established peace. \
But when the enemy is overwhelming, and retreat is impossible, \
it's time to commit everything, unleashing the "Spiral Power" to break the unbreakable!

Turn former adversaries into invaluable allies. \
Let ancient wisdom guide our journey forward. \
A slim chance is merely a limitation of numerical possibility. \
Infinite despair is simply a series of overcomable trials. \
The sacrifices of our allies will pave the way for us. \
The spirit of perseverance will keep us from losing our way.

It's time to show the children what's possible. \
It's time to tell the world who we are!
