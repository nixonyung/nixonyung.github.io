Good times breed corruption.<br/>
The weak assimilate the strong with a number advantage.<br/>
But you are still not me.<br/>

Bad times give birth to heroes.<br/>
The strong eliminate the weak with brute force.<br/>
Can you do it?<br/>

The winner takes it all:<br/>
The strong shed blood and tears to define the right way.<br/>
The weak beg for food and humbly survive.<br/>

Why do we always sacrifice the good?<br/>

From what I see, the strong know their strengths come from built roads.<br/>
Therefore, they accept that they have the responsibility to pave the way for future generations.<br/>
The weak are always afraid of losing what they have, cursing passersby for not giving them food.<br/>

That's why the rebel should be eaten.<br/>

The ghost, just as when it is alive, becomes Death.<br/>
Wherever it isn't, whatever dies.<br/>

Only my existence cannot be doubted.<br/>
Only what I observed is true.<br/>
God is dead.<br/>
I will become the God of the new world.<br/>
