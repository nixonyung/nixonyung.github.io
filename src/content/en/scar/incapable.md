Anything you do is correct<br/>
until you make someone cry,<br/>
and then your existence is a mistake.<br/>

Not sure if it is a dream or reality, I find myself lying on the ground,<br/>
surrounded by broken glass shards and some sort of liquid.<br/>

On the shards of glass appear memories of my past.<br/>
It was my first year after studying in a boy's school.<br/>
I simply couldn't understand girls.<br/>
Then a girl taught me<br/>
how heartbreaking it can be for a girl when the boy she likes tells her that he likes another girl.<br/>
What I saw was deeply imprinted in my mind.<br/>
Perhaps I am shedding the tears she was holding back.<br/>

Being pierced by broken mirrors,<br/>
the bloodstained me look immensely awful.<br/>
It appears to deny me finding girls who like me.<br/>
Or is it because of my lack of exposure to girls?<br/>
But repeated failures remind me that I am the root cause.<br/>
I can't grasp any opportunity even if it is presented right in front of me.<br/>
Now I realize that the broken mirrors on my body are to make me face my incompetence.<br/>
Bleeding doesn't change anything for a walking zombie.<br/>

Broken liquor bottles are blocking my way out.<br/>
It is said that liquor can let you forget the pain,<br/>
but I find it unable to rewrite history.<br/>
Liquor cannot drown the seed of sorrow;<br/>
Is there any part of me worth being loved?<br/>
Liquor cannot make a fool conscious;<br/>
Maybe I will come up with a reasonable answer if I am more drunk.<br/>
But in the end, even a pool of alcohol cannot wash away my sins.<br/>

> There is no person so severely punished, as those who subject themselves to

The dream is about to end. I look down at what's on the ground,<br/>
and it turns out that what's broken is my heart of glass<br/>
for being unable to confront the everlasting warmth from close friends.<br/>
Time flows, about to bring with it the fragments of my heart,<br/>
but I want to be able to respond to the warmth wholeheartedly.<br/>
I gather as many fragments as I can. Perhaps dropping a few.<br/>
Nevertheless, by letting go of what we were once incapable of, we can finally make ourselves whole.<br/>
