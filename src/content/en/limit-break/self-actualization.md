Self-actualization = being able to do whatever you can think of

> Everything you can imagine is real.
>
> \- [Pablo Picasso](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5521-everything-you-can-imagine-is-real)

Required steps:

1. learning meditation

   - only consider what is happening and ignore your interpretations of causal relationships

     > It's your own expectations that hurt you. Not the world you live in.
     > Whatever happens in the world is real. What you think should happen is
     > unreal.
     >
     > So people are hurt by their expectations. You know, you're not disappointed
     > by the world, you are disappointed by your own projections.
     >
     > \- [Jacque Fresco](https://quotefancy.com/quote/1195936/Jacque-Fresco-It-s-your-own-expectations-that-hurt-you-Not-the-world-you-live-in-Whatever)

2. finding your goal (a.k.a. Law of Attraction)

   - imagining yourself becoming the person you want to become, and by doing so
     you will subconsciously pay attention to relevant information
