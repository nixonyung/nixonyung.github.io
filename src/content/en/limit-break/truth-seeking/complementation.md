The naive are trapped by their minds.<br/>
The stubborn are bound by their truths.<br/>

Isn't it possible for a complete mind to achieve everything?<br/>
Fill the spirit so that it can cross the boundary ("the body") and impact reality.<br/>
Your existence leads to everything.<br/>

Isn't it true that any object can be analyzed?<br/>
Observe matters and we can answer what spirit is.<br/>
Your existence means nothing.<br/>

Each valid on its own,<br/>
the contradicting claims are yet coexisting,<br/>
as each is merely a different perspective on the world.<br/>

Let the gone be gone. Let the unspeakable be unspeakable.<br/>
Feelings are real. Theorems are true.<br/>
But what happened is happened. But what is here is here.<br/>
