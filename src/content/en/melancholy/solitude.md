People aren't inherently "extroverted" or "introverted".
Everyone has once shouted out their thoughts.
The difference lies only in how many like-minded people are around.

If there are plenty of like-minded people, with a bit of chatter you can find someone you can connect with.
You will become "extroverted" over time, surrounded by acquaintances and spending time happily with friends.

But if there are few like-minded people, you might feel like you're wasting your breath being misunderstood.
You will become "introverted" over time, feeling increasingly tired of communicating with others.

Nowadays everyone talks about MBTI.
I'm an INFP (though the parts other than the "I" fluctuates a lot) with 90+ score for the "I" - undeniably "introverted".

I've always been terrible at speaking.
Thinking back, it almost feels like I completely lack the ability to have a conversation.
I constantly failed oral exams in school and struggled to make small talk.

I've always considered my inability to speak well to be a weakness.

When I was in university,
being around so many people through academics, club activities, and tutoring forced me to speak more,
and I gradually learned to express what I was thinking.
Now, I find myself comfortably exchange ideas at work or
talking with friends about the interesting things I did during the weekend.

I once thought I should aim to be incredibly persuasive,
but really, communication just needs to be functional.
And it turns out that not being able to speak well doesn't have to stick with you forever,
everyone can learn how to communicate effectively.

But even after improving my communication skills,
that feeling of being isolated never really goes away.

Maybe it's a clash of interests?

My childhood was spent searching for fun web games,
waiting for new games to come out each week.
I especially remember Magic Tower, Hero Fighter, Sonny, and Anti-idle: The Game.

Stephen Chow's movies are the only movies that I find interesting.
As a kid, I used to watch God of Cookery and Flirting Scholar several times a day,
able to replay the entire movie in my brain with vivid details.

Sometimes I spend time randomly searching for songs on YouTube until I find something I like -
mostly instrumental music because I can't remember lyrics -
of all sorts of styles.

Reading has never been enjoyable for me because I find it so tiring to concentrate on the words,
but I resort to reading in the Central Library to find inspiration and broaden my horizons.

I code at work and also in my free time,
enjoying researching the most efficient and concise way to get something done.

Or maybe it's just a mismatch of personalities?

I don't know if it's because I'm used to watching videos at 3x speed,
but I pay a lot of attention to the key points of what people are saying.
My brain ignores anything that is just filler.

I don't like seeing men,
mostly because they're either rude and full of hot air, or unkempt and clueless.

Perhaps the only kind of people I enjoy interacting with are female seniors,
characterized by seldom laughing loudly.
They are easy to connect with and they will play along with my corny jokes.

I've never felt like I am the type of guy who deliberately tries to please people,
but I'm not sure if I am spending too much effort guessing how others feel.
I constantly think about how I can be even more myself.

Maybe I need to implement a "Me First" policy.

Prosperity masks corruption.
The weak assimilate the strong through numbers.

But you are still not me.

Chaos breeds heroes.
The strong eliminate the weak through force.

Can you do that?

The strong expend blood and tears, venturing out alone, heedless of the world;

The weak have only wit; they can only be imitators, bluffing and pretending.

The difference in strength matters greatly.
Even for people from the same origin, the strongest will always go the furthest.

If I followed everyone else's path, I wouldn't be lonely,
but I want to shine like a star.

I will try to understand you, but has anyone tried to understand me?

Only my will cannot be doubted.<br/>
Only what I observed is true.<br/>
God is dead, I am me.<br/>

It is worth searching a thousand miles for a kindred spirit if I can be accompanied at last.
