Most of my birthdays were celebrated with sushi —
or, if that wasn't possible, simply passed quietly.

Sushi was already a luxury for my family.

The people I've met in life generally haven't been wealthy,
and yet I haven't encountered anyone who came from a significantly harsher environment than mine.

Sometimes, seeing classmates and friends go on family trips,
enjoying meals and drinks, traveling,
and buying the latest phones and game consoles,
I would feel a pang of envy.

However, television often reminds me that
many people face far greater hardships:
living in cramped apartments,
struggling to afford basic, filling meals,
enduring domestic violence or divorce,
and being forced to drop out of school to support their families.

Considering my own situation,
our public housing isn't spacious, but it's comfortable.\
We often cook chicken or fish,
and I genuinely appreciate a good, filling meal.\
Occasionally, I wake up to my parents arguing,
but at least they don't smoke, drink,
gamble obsessively, or resort to violence.\
And the money I earn is mine to manage —
I just need to be responsible with my spending.

It often feels like I'm not qualified to complain about anything.

Or perhaps, somewhere out there, someone is even envying me,
especially considering my natural aptitude for math and problem-solving,
the absence of significant academic pressure,
and the fact that I never needed tutoring
(which I couldn't have afforded anyway).

Growing up, I experienced a few memorable events that significantly shaped my perspective.

(1)

One day after school,
my mom suddenly announced that we had a hacker living upstairs.
(Just don't ask me how she came to that conclusion.)
As a result, we were forbidden from using the internet or the computer.
This meant no video games,
and sometimes even completing homework became a challenge.

From Form 2 through Year 3,
I became a regular fixture at internet cafes, the mall near our home,
libraries, and the university campus - all just to get online.

(Then she suddenly agreed to renew the internet service.)

Looking back, I managed to play games, complete my homework,
and, surprisingly, the situation also increased my physical activity
and encouraged me to spend more time reading in the library.

I'm still unsure whether that period was ultimately
beneficial or detrimental to my development.

(2)

Lacking successful role models and not possessing a natural business aptitude,
I resorted to forcing myself to study more,
blindly hoping it would lead to a well-paying job.

I vividly remember taking eight courses during the Year 3 spring semester.

Studying from home was mandatory,
which meant I could skip lectures and watch the recordings at 4x speed.
Even with this advantage, those three months were a whirlwind of activity.
I spent them constantly watching recordings, completing assignments,
working on multiple projects, and taking exams.

Following immediately was a semester break,
and additionally an internship.
To complicate matters, my mom injured her hand,
preventing her from cooking.
I then had to buy food to bring home after already being exhausted from work.
I truly disliked buying rice noodles,
wasting much of my time waiting for the order,
and the heavy load nearly broke my fingers.

Finally, I reached the start of the next semester,
feeling like I had mastered studying and time management.
Surely, taking only five courses would be easy now, right?

Unfortunately, it wasn't.
Memorizing things had always been challenging to me.
And I found myself suffering from the lingering effects of memory overload -
I felt completely burned out and unable to think clearly.

Adding to this, I teamed up with three strangers - all free-riders -
at the four-person Final Year Project.
(Perhaps I deserved it -
I foolishly believed I could find skilled partners at random,
and turned down offers from friends.)
In the end, they only completed their own presentation scripts.
I handled all the coding, testing, report writing,
video editing, and demo presentation entirely on my own.

(3)

Not long after graduating,
I found a job with a decent income.
Finally, I was able to contribute financially and
started thinking about helping my family.

I envisioned a better future for my dad,
one where he wouldn't have to work two jobs and be so stressed,
and for our family, where we would no longer need to constantly scrimp and save.

I proudly told my dad my monthly salary was HKD$25,000,
and this was his reaction:
"I really envy you for having a much better life than me".

I shared with my mom that I had achieved
First Honor in HKUST CPEG (162 credits total),
and her response was:
"Don't get too full of yourself too quickly, the outside world is much bigger".

Their reactions vividly demonstrated what I now recognize as a "Poor Mindset".
It was then that I realized some problems simply couldn't be solved by money alone.

(Ultimately, I ended up contributing financially
just to cover our family's food expenses.)

As I get older,
I'm increasingly aware of feeling inherentedly "flawed".
There are certain patterns and struggles that I can't seem to shake.

I find it difficult to organize my thoughts and express them in writing.
Focusing on things that don't immediately interest me is a real challenge.
I need very clear, step-by-step explanations, and I tend to take things literally ...

I've been researching these tendencies,
and it seems like they could be related to autism.
Many of the characteristics resonate with my experiences -
repetitive behaviors, and a lack of physical coordination.

I've also seen discussions about difficulties with empathy,
although I have never considered myself heartless.
While I do try to understand how others are feeling, I often get it wrong.
It feels like I have to consciously learn how to understand them,
rather than instinctively knowing.
In this sense, maybe I do lack empathy.

Yet there are times I do feel I am genuinely heartless, easily cutting people off:

About two years ago, my parents were arguing intensely, for the N-th time,
debating whether my dad had cheated or not.
They were threatening divorce, and it was incredibly stressful.
(They're at their fifties and don't have any money, how can they really divorce?)

One evening, my father used a minor issue with the
laundry as an excuse to start ranting.
I was really annoyed and couldn't take it anymore,
and I snapped at him for the first time in my life,
telling him to "stop yelling".
And he responded with no respect: "If you feel noisy, just close the door".

Since then I ignored him completely.

About two months ago, my mom suffered a minor stroke and was hospitalized.
Since she returned, I've been reminding her to exercise,
even providing a video demonstrating gentle stretches.
I genuinely believe she needs to do this to prevent another stroke.

However, she responded with defensiveness, saying,
"My body is already very weak, why would I do exercise? Are you trying to kill me?"
I struggle to understand her perspective -
she doesn't have a job, has ample time at home and is still relatively mobile.
Is doing exercises really that difficult for her?

Since then I'm avoiding dealing with her.

A few years ago, my younger brother was late for his music exam.
He blamed my mother, and I initially believed he lied to our music teacher,
who had always been kind to us.
I reacted by withdrawing from him.

Recently, he reached out, and I learned the truth -
my mother had actually framed him.
We can now at least talk again.

I do have other relationships in my life:
my older sister,
friends I enjoy gaming with,
and friends from university whose company I appreciate.
However, I find myself lacking motivation to socialize much.

I'm not particularly drawn to most recreational activities.\
I rarely watch movies, television shows, or comics,
and only occasionally watch anime, as the pacing often feels slow.\
I struggle to enjoy pop music,
as I find it difficult to discern the lyrics,
and even when I can, I often don't understand them.\
Exercise is also challenging;
I have trouble with physical activity and become dizzy quickly.\
When I do go out,
I usually stick to simple meals like noodle soup or chicken rice.\
I don't generally enjoy the taste of other foods
(Gyudon beef rice is just okay actually) -
and I especially dislike anything sweet.\
Shopping feels like a waste of time because
I have little interest in things that cost money without a practical purpose.

I also find it difficult to muster motivation to meet new people.\
I don't connect with most people, often dismissing those with whom I struggle to communicate.\
(Roughly 80% of men and women worldwide.)\
I definitely dislike those with bad intentions,
and I'm also wary of anyone who seems potentially harmful.
This stems from a past experience where I was misled by an insurance agent.\
(Roughly 80% of the remaining men.)\
I also avoid those who appear directionless and
seek out others merely to pass the time,
to avoid them wasting my time on meaningless things.\
(Roughly 80% of the remaining men.)\
I simply block those who consistently criticize me,
regardless of whether their criticisms are valid or not -
they are the so-called "Energy Vampires".\
(Roughly 80% of the remaining men.)

As a result, I primarily interact with women (while finding potential girlfriends).

I've noticed a perplexing pattern in my interactions with women,
and I'm struggling to understand it.
it seems like women gradually stop responding to my messages.
It's almost as if they're deliberately withdrawing -
they might ignore me when we encounter each other on the street,
or stop engaging with my Instagram posts and stories.
Yet, they don't seem repulsed; they don't move away when I'm nearby
(the only cue I readily understand).

Could it be that they're simply playing hard to get?

I acknowledge that I can be oblivious when it comes to women's feelings,
and I'm not afraid to admit it.
Part of this difficulty, I believe, stems from my autistic traits.
It makes it very challenging for me to interpret subtle displays of affection
and detect irony in what they say.

And my understanding of "love" is often quantitative.
I analyze the smoothness of our interactions,
recall impulsive actions they've taken,
and investigate whether their actions are solely for me.

Even if I compensate for this stiffness with intelligence and experience,
or if they directly tell me they love me,
I still encounter a barrier within myself:
a tendency to deny the kindness of others.

I find myself constantly questioning things, plagued by thoughts like,\
"Why are you so nice to me? Is this just coincidence or friendly gestures?\
Do you really know who I am? Why would you like this ordinary person?\
Are you really talking to me?\
What position do I hold in your heart? Could anyone simply replace me?"

Even after we've known each other for a while, after many things have happened,
I can't help but constantly question our relationship,
imagining them leaving me at any moment,
finding someone more perfect and interesting.
(Opening an Instagram story is often accompanied by the anxiety of potentially opening a Pandora's box.)

I hesitate to do anything that might confirm our relationship,
fearing I'll overstep boundaries or go against their feelings.
But if I do nothing, I worry they'll eventually grow bored,
their passion and patience gradually fading.

And so, I can only watch helplessly as they move on to a better life,
leaving behind the "troublesome" person I am.

Watching your hard work crumble is far more frustrating than enduring hardship.

Ruthlessly pushing my own limits,
only to gain no tangible skills;\
striving for a better future for my family,
yet not even receiving a simple acknowledgment of effort;\
repeatedly pushing myself to change,
only to repeatedly disappoint myself ...

Gradually, a cold voice began to surface in my mind,
shadowing my every thought and relentlessly questioning me.

"Am I not doing enough?\
Do I not deserve good things?"

It was a whisper from the Death.

It declared these sentiments again and again:\
"You are totally worthless, utterly incapable of anything;\
if you don't finish everything by the deadline, you are as good as dead;\
everyone is obstructing you, no one will understand or help you;\
you are responsible for everything, and any setback is a consequence of your failures."

These doctrines filled my mind,
a heavy pressure against my head.
I felt a dark, unseen liquid flowing out of me.

I grew increasingly unable to bear the weight of it,
yearning to scream, to sing out my laments.\
I began to distill these words into writings,
seeking a small space to breathe within myself, exploring a path to survival.\
Again and again I wrote,
trying to detach myself from the resentment, attempting to redeem myself.

I just want to be normal.

No idea how long passed.
Then, a sudden thought jolted me:\
Are these words I'm writing a reflection of what the Death says, or do I say them?

With newfound courage, I faced the Death, removed its mask,
and to my surprise, discovered a profound truth:
it was me, and I was it.

The voice wasn't an external entity;
it was merely the words I was afraid to speak aloud,
manifested as another aspect of my own personality.

Perhaps it was time for me to grow up,
to learn to articulate what I truly want with my own voice.

Will speaking up make people dislike me?
Maybe they don't think about these things as much as I do.

Perhaps I should learn to be a rebel.

Today is my 25th birthday.

I used to daydream about what I'd be like at this age:
a skilled coder, earning a good income,
incredibly proficient at gaming and drumming,
and being attractive to all the beautiful girls.

Sigh, it looks like I still have some work to do.
