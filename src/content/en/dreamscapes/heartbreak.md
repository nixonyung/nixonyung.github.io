Untainted by consequences,\
Until a tear descends,\
Regret's echo lingers.

---

Uncertain if it's dream or reality,
I find myself on the ground,
surrounded by shards of glass and pools of an unknown liquid.

The fractured glass reflects fragments of a past -
my first year at university, a stark contrast to years spent in a boys' school.
I found myself unable to comprehend the subtle nuances of a woman's heart.

A girl showed me how heartbreaking it can be
to hear the person you love declare their affection for another.
That scene remains, deeply etched within me.

The tears I shed now â€” could they be the tears she desperately held back?

---

Each shard of the mirror pierces my body,
leaving me a bloodied reflection,
a haunting visage that seems to deny me the possibility of love.

Is it a consequence of my inexperience with women?
Yet, repeated failures whisper a stark truth:
My solitude doesn't stem from fate, but from failing to seize the moments offered.
Even when opportunity lies before me, I find myself incapable of embracing it.

The broken mirror forced me to confront my own inadequacy,
revealing a diminished, flawed man.
My blood drains, yet leaves no effect; I am already a walking corpse.

---

Shattered bottles scatter the ground, offering no path forward.
They say liquor can quell the storm,
but why can't it rewrite history?

Wine cannot drown the seeds of sorrow:
is there anything worthy within this foolish, troubled soul to warrant love's embrace?
Wine cannot sober up the ignorant:
I, not yet fully drunk, cannot ramble out an answer.

Even a boundless sea of wine cannot wash away the stains of the past.

The dream dissolves. I gaze upon the debris, and with sudden clarity, I see:\
It was my own heart of glass that fractured,
incapable of weathering the warmth of my "close friends".

You silently accompanied me through the darkest days,\
reminding me to cherish the bonds around me;\
You bravely spoke your love,\
demonstrating the purest form of devotion;\
You urged me onward, to explore the world alone,\
to become the most alluring man I could be.

I longed to respond to your warmth wholeheartedly,
to return that warmth in kind.

I gather the scattered fragments of my heart, clasping them tight.\
Perhaps a few must fall, but by releasing the spikes within our hearts,
we may finally become whole.
