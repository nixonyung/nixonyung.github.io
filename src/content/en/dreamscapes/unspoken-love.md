If you were once forced to end a relationship with your girlfriend,
and then she returns, but you're already in a new one,
would you choose the old flame or the current relationship?

The honest, often unspoken answer deep inside many men's hearts is invariably, "both".

I'm simple-minded; I act on my feelings.
I'm willing to be labeled a "bad guy" to explore the possibility of "having both".

Usually, accusations of cheating involve betraying a commitment.
But if I were to bluntly announce from the start,
"I love every beautiful woman",
am I not then free from being deceptive?

I've met some intelligent girls with whom I share a great deal to talk about.

I always make it clear to those around me about my desire for multiple relationships.
Surprisingly, you didn't shy away after learning that.
I took that as acceptance.

I hesitated once about abandoning the "bad guy" persona,
wanting to settle down and focus on you.
But when I tried to deepen our connection, you began to avoid me.
Soon after, I saw photos of you on Instagram with a boyfriend seemingly out of nowhere.

It turned out you were simply using me to pass the time,
indulging your fantasies of being a femme fatale.

I was prepared from the start for the possibility that women, too,
might be inclined to flirt with multiple men.
I envisioned an open relationship —
a situation where either party could freely pursue other promising people.
However, your boyfriends didn't strike me as particularly impressive;
they simply seemed to have richer backgrounds and
plenty of time to shower you with attention.

I was always the one left over and betrayed.

Initially, I wondered if I was the problem,
or if you were already deeply connected to someone else.
But the same pattern kept happening.

I finally realized that women share the same sexual fantasy with men —
a preference for someone who loves them endlessly, does everything for them,
yet isn't entirely self-sufficient,
helplessly needing their company to survive.

It's ironic that both men and women might desire that from their partners,
but would likely criticize a friend displaying
such dependence as being taken advantage of.

I used to share this kind of emotional dependency
and dreamt of "wonderful futures".
However, getting to know a few female friends quickly dispelled those fantasies.
Those kind of thoughts turned out to be solely wishful thinking.

I've slowly learned that liking someone isn't solely about feelings;
it's about communication and understanding.
Everyone's preferences and behaviors are unique.
True connection is forged through continuous exchange.

If you're not on the same wavelength,
even if you keep saying "I love you" to each other,
you're simply expressing your love to an idealized version of the other person.

Thanks to you, I now doubt the sincerity of expressions of love I receive,
questioning if it's all just a mirage.
I'm so afraid of losing the people I want to love, again and again.

Every man desire physical contact with beautiful women,
but it isn't necessarily driven by love;
it's often a primal instinct.

A man's body is also cursed, but not in the way women's are —
burdened with pain and inconveniences.
It's the uncontrollable libido:
a boner in the morning,
a boner while doing nothing,
a boner when he sees a beautiful woman even when he is busy.
It's a constant reminder: a man's life purpose is to get women's bodies.

While most men are naturally inclined toward women's bodies,
simply offering your body to a man won't guarantee his love in response.
To captivate an experienced man, you might need to do more.

Appearance is an entry ticket; men are visual creatures after all.
Having a good look and a stunning body is a strong advantage,
but a woman who knows how to dress can appear even more attractive.

Men generally have a few but dedicated personal interests.
A woman willing to understand a man's interests,
spend time together, and grow together can spark fondness.
Shared, even obscure, interests can further deepen the bond.

Giving your man compliments, no matter how big or small, will delight him,
and he might even literally end up teary - eyed in your arms if he trusts you.

Men are more moved by gradual affection than grand declarations of love.
Men often envision a perfect relationship as weathering life's challenges together.

Well, after all this talk, I have to admit my love language is still physical contact.

When seeing couples flaunt how much they love each other —
constantly showering each other with gifts and traveling around the world —
I often feel like it's more of a performance than a heartfelt offering.

Of course, I'm grateful for a thoughtful and meaningful gift if I receive one.
I also think spending time together and creating beautiful memories is very important.
Meanwhile, someone not investing any effort on gifts and activities might seem like
they aren't appreciating the other one's company enough.
Yet, I don't think the act of gifting and accompanying can be equated with love.

Instead, I've found that our bodies' instinctive reactions more
honestly reveal our true feelings.

When you are touched by someone you love,
it's not like you will immediately become uncontrollable.
You might wait for them to initiate further contact,
waiting for a more obvious opportunity to respond.
Maybe you're inexperienced, not knowing what to do,
or perhaps it just isn't the right time.

But being touched by someone you don't like will always result in
an immediate and decisive withdrawal —
an instinctive distancing, maybe just three centimeters,
or maybe three kilometers to the extreme.

The level of sexual tension between a couple often reflects
how far their relationship can go.

Even after a heated argument,
spouses can appear like nothing bad had ever happened after
cuddling together at night.

Being attuned to each other at work or with household chores means
little if the couple couldn't hold hands to express intimacy.
A stale relationship without affection is easily infiltrated by a third party.

Physical contact is the hidden mating dance embedded in our primal instincts:

First, eye contact;\
Then, gradually closing the distance;\
Pretending to be oblivious when making the first touch;\
then, subtle, provocative touches;\
then, passionate rubbing.\
Feeling the other person's body gradually heat up —\
it's a way of conveying to me:\
"I have conquered not only your body but also your heart".

Ultimately, men are all like this:
they are interested in your body regardless of whether they love you or not.

Sometimes, even ourselves can't distinguish if we're drawn to someone
because of their personality or their body.
Therefore, when we want to confirm our love for someone,
we force ourselves to separate them from our sexual fantasies —
to see if we still have affection for them.

For a man, love words like "I love you" and "I miss you" are
equivalent to "I want to have sex with you".
Therefore, when we want to express our love to someone,
we will deliberately avoid excessive sentimentality,
wanting to differentiate ourselves from those who use sweet words to deceive.

When a man loves you, he might not shout out "I love you";
he just wants to keep seeing you smile.

When you like someone, you're likely always thinking about how to confess.

Perhaps in the morning, while doing nothing, or even when you're busy,
you find yourself pondering how to make your feelings seem sincere.
You might rehearse what you'll say countless times in your head,
imagining a heartfelt declaration that cannot be refused —
a declaration that promises the start of a blissful relationship.

But in the end, I couldn't say anything to you.

That's how it was when I chased after you.\
That's how it was during the final class.\
That's how it was even when you came to me, seemingly wanting to say something.

I haven't really changed much.
I still can't face you and say, "I like you".
Yet, what hasn't changed is that I still cherish the version of you I hold in my memory.

I wonder what you're like now?
Does the gentleness behind your rejection still linger?

I'm living up to what I said to you back then.

Perhaps you haven't looked into what I wrote,\
or perhaps you no longer feel anything for me,\
or perhaps you've changed a lot.

But I am always ready for your return, waiting for you to be my 381st girlfriend.

Should fate decree we meet once more,
I'll forgo the words I long to pour.
I will just come and take your hand.
