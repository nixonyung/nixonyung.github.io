Ignorance is the key to transcendence.<br/>
No need to worry about being incompetent,<br/>
delegate responsibilities to others,<br/>
and be free to pursue happiness.<br/>

Those who dare to realize the truth,<br/>
will bare the pain for not being understood,<br/>
will be obligated to evaluate what is correct and what is wrong,<br/>
will inevitably opt to sacrifice themselves for the common good.<br/>

Simply saying "I don't know",<br/>
to let others solve your problems,<br/>
to be irresponsible as if granted.<br/>
Simply saying "I wanna eat",<br/>
taking precious lives from the nature,<br/>
demanding enormous efforts from countless people.<br/>
Simply saying "It's not what I want",<br/>
truth is distorted at your will,<br/>
feelings are erased like they don't matter.<br/>

Ignorance is bliss.<br/>
Realizing is misery.<br/>
