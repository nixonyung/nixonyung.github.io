We all long to be good.<br/>

Some say it is to avoid conflicts,<br/>
gradually forgetting what they want and losing themselves.<br/>
Some say it is to provide others with the best,<br/>
dictating other's fate in the name of love and care.<br/>
Some say it is to follow rules,<br/>
forgoing destructions and thus creations.<br/>

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so as good and evil.<br/>
What's good may end up being bad, and what's bad may turn out to be good.<br/>
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.<br/>
Damage has to be done to protect our loved ones.<br/>

Let's flatten the moral high ground.<br/>

You can dislike clashes,<br/>
while still saying out your thoughts loud.<br/>
You can care for others<br/>
while respecting feedback.<br/>
You can avoid losses<br/>
while fixing the worst parts of the world.<br/>

And for whatever you do,<br/>
if you end up losing yourselves,<br/>
if you make your loved ones cry,<br/>
if you get held back by piles of faulty stuff,<br/>
it is just bad.<br/>
