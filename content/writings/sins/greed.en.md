It seems to say "money is the root of all evil".<br/>

We will be blinded by money, giving everything in exchange for wealth,<br/>
and at the end we kill the goose and get no more golden eggs.<br/>
But being poor will eventually starve to death.<br/>

We will be deceived by alluring looks, comprehending brands as the symbol of status,<br/>
and at the end the emperor's new clothes become a laughing stock.<br/>
But being in a lower position will inevitably lead to an inferiority complex.<br/>

We will be corrupted by luxurious lifestyles, relying on money to solve everything,<br/>
and at the end ruining the families, the countries.<br/>
But being incompetent will inescapably be defeated by reality.<br/>

It should be this?<br/>

> The love of money is the root of all evil.
>
> \- [1 Timothy 6:10 KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%206%3A10&version=KJV)

Or this?<br/>

> The lack of money is the root of all evil.
>
> \- [Mark Twain](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/81045-the-lack-of-money-is-the-root-of-all-evil)

Or both?<br/>

Perhaps the root of all evil is people's superstition about money.<br/>
People believe that simply holding money will fulfill their never-ending wishes.<br/>
Although it is true that money can be exchanged for things of the same value, it is us who create value.<br/>
