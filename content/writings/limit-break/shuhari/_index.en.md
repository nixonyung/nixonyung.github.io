"Shuhari" originated from Japanese Kendo:

1. "Shu" (守): to obey the tradition (e.g. the mainstream ideas, the masters' teachings)

   - expanding your horizon

     - e.g. look up whatever you can think of on Google and YouTube

     > Smart people learn from everything and everyone,
     >
     > average people from their experiences,
     >
     > stupid people already have all the answers.
     >
     > \- [Socrates](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10408021-smart-people-learn-from-everything-and-everyone-average-people-from)

   - learning how to learn

     - e.g. imitating others
     - e.g. remembering, using "spaced repetition"
     - e.g. associating new concepts with what you already know
       - e.g. when learning vocabulary you should also learn the synonyms
       - e.g. relating similar concepts, even in different subjects
       - e.g. visualization
     - e.g. taking notes
       - develop your vocabulary and structure, so that you can regain the knowledge in the future with ease
     - e.g. divide and conquer
       - e.g. when learning an instrument, you should first practice the
         fundamentals (e.g. volume control, scales, coordination, how to perfect a
         single note), then the rudiments, then a few songs, then improvisation,
         ...

2. "Ha" (破): to break the tradition and try new ideas

   - expanding your comfort zone

     - to try things you haven't seen

       - e.g. via inspiration (a.k.a. being genius)
       - e.g. via random experiments

       > Unless you change how you are, you will always have what you've got.
       >
       > \- [Jim Rohn](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/364884-unless-you-change-how-you-are-you-will-always-have)

   - reconstructing your comfort zone

     - to be as simple as possible

       - then you better understand what you have
       - then you can spend less effort to use what you have

       > If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.
       >
       > \- [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/19421-if-you-can-t-explain-it-to-a-six-year-old)

     - to form new ideas from what we already know

       > Creativity is taking known elements and putting them together in unique
       > ways.
       >
       > \- [Jacque Fresco](https://quotefancy.com/quote/1196029/Jacque-Fresco-Creativity-is-taking-known-elements-and-putting-them-together-in-unique)

3. "Ri" (離): to discard the tradition and do what we want

   - you do what you think, and you can explain what you do.<br/>

   - and you are back to "Shu"

   > 兵無常勢，水無常形，能因敵變化而取勝者，謂之神。
