自我實現 = 你做到你諗到嘅嘢

> Everything you can imagine is real.
>
> \- [Pablo Picasso](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5521-everything-you-can-imagine-is-real)

必經步驟：

1. 學習冥想

   - 專心於現實世界發生緊嘅嘢，刻意忽略你對事物前因後果嘅猜想

     > It's your own expectations that hurt you. Not the world you live in.
     > Whatever happens in the world is real. What you think should happen is
     > unreal.
     >
     > So people are hurt by their expectations. You know, you're not disappointed
     > by the world, you are disappointed by your own projections.
     >
     > \- [Jacque Fresco](https://quotefancy.com/quote/1195936/Jacque-Fresco-It-s-your-own-expectations-that-hurt-you-Not-the-world-you-live-in-Whatever)

2. 認清目標 (a.k.a. 吸引力法則)

   - 想像自己成為左自己想成為嘅模樣，然後你會下意識留意相關嘅資訊

     > What you aim at determines what you see.
     >
     > \- [Jordan B. Peterson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9108708-what-you-aim-at-determines-what-you-see)

3. 付諸實行

   - 令自己身處喺鼓勵你行動嘅環境

     > You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.
     >
     > \- [James Clear](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9548184-you-should-be-far-more-concerned-with-your-current-trajectory)

   - 要向前走先會知道條路要點行

     > The first draft of anything is shit.
     >
     > \- [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/52073-the-first-draft-of-anything-is-shit)

   - 從經驗學習

     > The key to learning is feedback. It is nearly impossible to learn anything without it.
     >
     > \- [Steven D. Levitt](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1214269-the-key-to-learning-is-feedback-it-is-nearly-impossible)
