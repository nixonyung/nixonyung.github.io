There are no introverts and extroverts.<br/>
We simply want to express ourselves.<br/>
Those who are good at expressing themselves can see each other easily and become "extroverts".<br/>
Those who are not good at expressing themselves have no means to find resonance and become "introverts".<br/>

I see my friends doing interesting things,<br/>
but I can only wait for them to invite me.<br/>
I understand the power of words,<br/>
but I can only speak with actions.<br/>
I get whatever hints you give to me,<br/>
but I can only respond with the sound of silence.<br/>
