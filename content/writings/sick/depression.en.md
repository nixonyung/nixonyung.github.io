(Disclaimer: loosely based on my personal experience but lack scientific evidence)

## Root Cause

> You have been trying but failing to get what you have assumed to be essential for your survival.

- e.g. you believe your exam results will determine your life, but you are underperforming
- e.g. you are still young, but you lack the parental love you need
- e.g. you value relationships, but you get abandoned
- e.g. you have to make money for your family, but you are stuck in your career
- e.g. perinatal depression, afraid of your kids' health

## Development

- you suffer in reality because of the thing you lack

  - e.g. feeling stressed because of the lack of ability to deal with schoolwork
  - e.g. feeling abandoned because of the lack of support
  - e.g. lives go hard because of the lack of a nice-paid job
  - e.g. feeling pain because of the lack of love
  - e.g. feeling irritated because of witnessing your kids to be sick

- you get held back when you are trying to get the thing you lack

  - e.g. you get distracted by others when you are studying hard
  - e.g. your parents are always fighting, and it affects you negatively
  - e.g. you are confused by the thought that you are the better choice but you are not with the one you love
  - e.g. you think that you are stuck in your career because of the lack of luck/chances
  - e.g. you try to find someone to talk to, but they do not understand your situation and think you are just having a bad time

## Symptoms

- being hopeless

- giving yourself negative tags

  - e.g. always thinking negatively
  - e.g. not being able to accomplish anything

- you are in pain, but you are telling others "I'm fine", thinking that they can never understand your situation

- the accumulated negative emotions form a new personality as a defense mechanism

  - e.g. a feeling of hearing a voice persecuting you
  - e.g. recalling your mistakes
  - e.g. thoughts of self-harm/thoughts of bloody scenes, even though you want to survive
  - e.g. tendency for aggressive behaviors

- lack of energy and motivation, constant irritating headache

## Resolution

- bear in mind that depression consists of both negative emotions and problems in real life

  - do not deny your negative emotions
    - find appropriate ways to release them
      - e.g. develop interests
      - e.g. see your friends more
    - review the reasons behind you putting negative tags on yourself
      - e.g. why do you consider yourself as "not being able to accomplish
        anything"?<br/>
        --> because you are getting bad grades at school<br/>
        --> realize that in fact "getting bad grades at school" does not mean "you are not
        able to accomplish anything"
        - e.g. in fact you are just constantly scolded by your parents
        - e.g. in fact your grades are not good enough for you to choose your
          favorite subject, and so you think that your life is destined to fail
  - consider other ways to solve your problems
    - e.g. give up things that are not suitable for you, ignore people who do not suit you
    - e.g. when you get stuck in life, discuss your assumptions about life with others to see if you are wrong
    - e.g. practice the art of communication

- do not abandon who you are, you must eventually face your "dark side" and realize it is a part of you
