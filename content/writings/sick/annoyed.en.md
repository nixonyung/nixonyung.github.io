I hate when things are out of my expectations because it leaves me clueless about what to do next;<br/>
I hate changes without reason because it is troublesome to relearn;<br/>
I hate people who don't know what is in their minds because then I can't predict their actions;<br/>
I hate that I have to first trust people before I know who I shouldn't trust;<br/>
I hate to see in other people the bad qualities that I have eliminated in myself;<br/>
I hate psychopaths, having no feelings and opinions and then shirking responsibilities to others;<br/>
I hate narcissists, being unable to see things from others' perspectives and therefore thinking everyone would agree with whatever they do;<br/>
I hate sociopaths, feeling excited when hurting others;<br/>
I hate the world for "respecting different opinions" on things that have obvious solutions;<br/>
I hate that I am inherently a psychopath, lacking empathy and perceving everything as patterns and causal relationships;<br/>
I hate being manipulative;<br/>
I hate being the kind of person I hate to describe what I hate;<br/>
I hate hating everything;<br/>
I hate that I am the only one I know trying to reveal qualities in things that shouldn't be hated;<br/>
I hate that people I don't hate always end up being people I hate;<br/>
I hate being alone in my world;<br/>
I hate myself.<br/>
