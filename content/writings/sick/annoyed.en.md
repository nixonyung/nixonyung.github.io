I hate when things are out of my expectations because it leaves me clueless about what to do next;<br/>
I hate changes without reason because it is troublesome to relearn;<br/>
I hate people who don't know what is in their minds because then I can't predict their actions;<br/>
I hate that I have to first trust people before I know who I shouldn't trust;<br/>
I hate to see in other people the bad qualities that I have eliminated in myself;<br/>
I hate men being arrogant, saying a few big words and then thinking whatever they do are correct;<br/>
I hate women being copy cats, doing things without distinguishing what's good or bad, and whether the things fit themselves;<br/>
I hate the world for "respecting different opinions" on things that have obvious solutions;<br/>
I hate that I am also an arrogant person;<br/>
I hate being the kind of person I hate to describe what I hate;<br/>
I hate hating everything;<br/>
I hate that I am the only one who can see in things the qualities that shouldn't be hated;<br/>
I hate that people I don't hate always end up being people I hate;<br/>
I hate being alone in my world;<br/>
I hate myself.<br/>
