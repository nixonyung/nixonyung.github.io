I won't be alone if I just follow others,<br/>
but I have found my Polaris.<br/>
I want to be myself,<br/>
but then I will deviate from others' tracks.<br/>
I want someone to witness my light,<br/>
but how can a star steal the sun's spotlight?<br/>

I put on a good show with all I have.<br/>
Heaven knows. Earth knows. I know.<br/>
No one knows.<br/>

The show is over, left with a glimpse of my light.<br/>
My dream is over, left with the ashes of a lonely star.<br/>

> I ought to have ... become a star in the sky.
