What if you are not feeling happy about receiving something valuable?<br/>
What if you are not feeling sad about losing something valuable?<br/>

If you can't recall the last time you were happy or sad,<br/>
are you then a stranger to yourself?<br/>
If we all have emotions but you have none,<br/>
can you be considered as a human?<br/>
If you are not feeling your heartbeat,<br/>
how can you tell if you are alive?<br/>

Or maybe it's because the enthusiasm you once had was denied.<br/>
Or maybe it's because you want to make sure that the person or object meets your expectations.<br/>
Or maybe it's because you were born reluctant to change.<br/>
Or maybe it's because the world is indeed dull.<br/>
