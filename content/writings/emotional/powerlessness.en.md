People wish "not to regret things you haven't done".<br/>
I gave all I can, not leaving any room for regret.<br/>
Still I am not achieving anything.<br/>

People reassure others, saying "failure leads to success".<br/>
I tried anything I could think of, again and again.<br/>
Still I am not achieving anything.<br/>

People believe "we can change the world by changing ourselves".<br/>
I refined myself, ready to challenge the world.<br/>
Still I am not achieving anything.<br/>

Perhaps the world could be less annoying.<br/>
Perhaps we can do better.<br/>
But the thought alone is annoying enough.<br/>
