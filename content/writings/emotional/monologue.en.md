There are no introverts and extroverts.<br/>
We simply want to express ourselves.<br/>
Those who are good at expressing themselves can see each other easily and become "extroverts".<br/>
Those who are not good at expressing themselves have no means to find resonance and become "introverts".<br/>

Birds of a feather flock together.<br/>
Me, alone, walking my own path.<br/>
Do I look like I am living in my own world?<br/>
I am waiting for my guests.<br/>
