We see "someone we want to live with" and "someone we want to have sex with" differently.<br/>
Also, men and women both have distinct definitions of these people.<br/>

- For men:
  - "someone we want to live with" ("wife material"): a good homemaker, emotionally supportive, respectful
  - "someone we want to have sex with" ("sexy girls"): beautiful, good in bed
- For women:
  - "someone we want to live with" ("boyfriend material"): rich, never-complaining, always available
  - "someone we want to have sex with" ("charming men"): talented, attentive, dominant, popular with women, good in bed

Given that society forbids the indulgence of sexual desire, plus the fact that we want a family from a certain age,
we control our lust and commit to a relationship.<br/>
Still, we want "someone we want to live with" to also play the role of "someone we want to have sex with":<br/>
men want their wives to stay beautiful;<br/>
women want their husbands to strive.<br/>

The origin of the urge to cheat is then trivial:<br/>
"someone we want to live with" is not "someone we want to have sex with".<br/>

- When men have a say in the dating market:

  Men look for "wife material";<br/>
  Women look for someone they can depend on.<br/>
  Men cheat with beautiful women because it is fun;<br/>
  Women cheat with men with high status to fulfill their emotional needs.<br/>

- When women have a say in the dating market:

  Women look for "boyfriend material";<br/>
  Men look for someone they can eventually have sex with.<br/>
  Women flirt with charming men on the street;<br/>
  Men have to learn to be charming.<br/>
