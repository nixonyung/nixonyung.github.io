People wish "not to regret things you haven't done".<br/>
I have already done all I can.<br/>
Leaving no regrets, but also not getting anything.<br/>

People reassure others, saying "Failure leads to success".<br/>
I have already done all I can.<br/>
Yet persistence leads me to nowhere.<br/>

People believe "we can change the world by changing ourselves".<br/>
I have already done all I can.<br/>
Still I haven't replaced all the obsolete stuff.<br/>

It is said that "Chance favors the prepared mind."<br/>
Then where are my chances?<br/>
Am I not good enough?<br/>
Am I not as good as those who have got their chances?<br/>

A flower cannot blossom without sunshine.<br/>
An unchosen one is doomed to achieve nothing.<br/>
