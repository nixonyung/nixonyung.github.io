When your body is sick,<br/>
you don't want to move.<br/>
Drink more water and rest more, and you will slowly get better.<br/>

When your mind is sick,<br/>
you can move, you can laugh, but you don't want to breathe.<br/>
Leaving it alone, stains will slowly form.<br/>

Uncuttable. Unsortable.<br/>
"Why am I like this?"<br/>
Am I just nagging?<br/>
Am I just stressed out?<br/>
Am I even trying to save myself?<br/>

It is the only way out.<br/>
Clean up my heart bit by bit from the surface.<br/>
Article after article, maybe at last I can become a better person.<br/>
