Not feeling happy for having.<br/>
Not feeling sad for losing.<br/>

If I can't recall the last time I was happy or sad,<br/>
am I stranger than a stranger?<br/>
If we all have emotions<br/>
but I am having none, what am I?<br/>
If I am not feeling my heartbeat,<br/>
how do I know I am alive?<br/>

Maybe it's because my enthusiasm I once had was denied.<br/>
Maybe it's because I want to make sure that the person or object meet my expectation.<br/>
Maybe it's because I am born reluctant to changes.<br/>
Maybe it's because the world is indeed dull.<br/>
