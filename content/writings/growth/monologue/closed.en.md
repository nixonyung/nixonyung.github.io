I won't be alone if I just follow others,<br/>
but I have found my Polaris.<br/>
I want to be myself,<br/>
but then I will deviate from others' tracks.<br/>
I want someone to witness my light,<br/>
but a star cannot steal the sun's spotlight.<br/>

I put on a good show with all I have.<br/>
Heaven knows. Earth knows. I know.<br/>
No one knows.<br/>

The show is closed, left with a glimpse of my light.<br/>
My orbit is closed, left with ashes of a lonely star.<br/>

> A show without an audience is nothing, after all.
>
> In the response of the audience, that is where the power of performance lives.
