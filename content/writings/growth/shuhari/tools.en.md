The human mind is composed of feelings and thoughts.<br/>
Beyond the mind is the material world.<br/>
The mind wants the world to work the way the mind does.<br/>

> Tools are what we use to realize our thoughts.

Examples：

- our bodies

  - to move ourselves in the world
  - to interact with things / tools in the world

- human inventions

  - to apply science in everyday life and solve problems

    - e.g. mechanical systems
      - as an alternative way to interact with things / other tools in the world
    - e.g. electronics
      - to manipulate data
    - e.g. factories
      - to change the states of objects

- art tools

  - e.g. in photography (art form) we may use a digital camera (tool) to create
    a digital file (tool) which can be viewed on a computer (tool) to show what
    you photographed

- companies

  - to make money from money

- societies

  - to reallocate resources via political systems so that as many people as
    possible can survive
  - we all have different definitions of "how to ensure as many people as possible can survive"
    - e.g. Confucianism: everyone has their own duties
    - e.g. Elitism: the most capable should take over
    - e.g. Legalism: ruling the country by law
    - e.g. Welfarism: we are all equal
    - e.g. Anarchism: to let people to find their own paths from absolute freedom

We make tools to save time and effort on repetitive work.<br/>
We use tools from our predecessors to save time and effort on making tools.<br/>
Tools persist in the material world, carrying its creators' thoughts.<br/>
But the tools will wear out; the ideas it carries will become obsolete.<br/>
If you don't like something, just try to make it what you want it to be.<br/>
