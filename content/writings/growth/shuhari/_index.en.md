- "Shu" (守): to obey the tradition (i.e. the mainstream ideas, the masters' teachings)
- "Ha" (破): to break the tradition and try new ideas
- "Ri" (離): to discard the tradition and do what we want

- you have to learn how to learn

  - imitating
  - associating new concepts with what you already know
    - e.g. when learning a new language you should use a dictionary in that language
    - e.g. visualization
  - practicing individual aspects, then combining them together
    - e.g. when learning a new language, you should first learn the
      pronunciations, then the words (e.g. everyday words, synonyms), and
      then the grammar to form sentences, and then how to apply contexts
      when grouping sentences into paragraphs / dialogues
    - e.g. when learning a piece of music, you should first learn the
      individual notes, then a group of notes, then a few measures, then
      finally the whole piece
    - e.g. when learning an instrument, you should first practice the
      fundamentals (e.g. volume control, scales, coordination), then the
      rudiments, then a few songs, then improvisation
  - "spaced repetition"
  - taking notes so that the future you can regain the knowledge
    - e.g. by developing your own vocabulary and structure

### Ha (破)

1. to expand your comfort zone

   - to try things you haven't seen

     - e.g. via inspiration (a.k.a. being genius)
     - e.g. via random experiments

2. to reconstruct your comfort zone

   - try to be as simple as possible

     - then you better understand what you have
     - then you can spend less effort to use what you have
