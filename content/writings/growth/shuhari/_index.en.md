"Shuhari" originated from Japanese Kendo:

- "Shu" (守): to obey the tradition (i.e. the mainstream ideas, the masters' teachings)
- "Ha" (破): to break the tradition and try new ideas
- "Ri" (離): to discard the tradition and do what we want

### Shu (守)

> To replicate what you see.

- "what you see":

  - you have to first know what you are trying to achieve

- "replicate":

  - to imitate without thinking

    - the more "accurate" the better

      - you have to observe the details of your target

      - you have to practice and deliberately comparing yourself with the ideal image

    - the more "diverse" the better

      - you have to know how we learn

        - e.g. associating new concepts with what you already know
          - e.g. when learning a new language you should use a dictionary in that language
          - e.g. visualization
        - e.g. taking notes so that the future you can regain the knowledge
          - e.g. by developing your own vocabulary and structure
        - e.g. spaced repetition

      - you have to expand your horizon

        - Google and YouTube whatever you can think of

### Ha (破)

1. > To expand your comfort zone.

   - to try things you haven't seen

     - e.g. via inspiration (a.k.a. being genius)
     - e.g. via random experiments

2. > To reconstruct your comfort zone.

   - try to be as simple as possible

     - then you better understand what you have
     - then you can spend less effort to use what you have

### Ri (離)

> You do what you think, and you can explain what you do.

And returns to [Shu](#shu-守).
