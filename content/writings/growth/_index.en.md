Home<br/>
= quarrels<br/>
= poor mindset<br/>

Schools<br/>
= emptiness<br/>
= boredom<br/>

Me<br/>
= flaws<br/>
= what?<br/>

What's good and evil?<br/>
Where am I heading to?<br/>
Who will bring me light?<br/>

Asking questions is futile.<br/>
Ignoring parents.<br/>
Befriending loneliness.<br/>
Reconciling with myself.<br/>
And I will bring myself light.<br/>
