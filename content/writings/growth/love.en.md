What is love?<br/>

No reasons are required for love.<br/>
Only those who lack love need reasons.<br/>

And they are left not being able to understand love.<br/>
They may break the chain of hatred.<br/>
But scratch an altruist and watch a "hypocrite" bleed.<br/>

Only the companioned can opt to be alone.<br/>
Only the loved can tolerate distance.<br/>
Only by having nothing to lose can the dreaded become fearless.<br/>
Only by proving themselves can the worthless find their values.<br/>
