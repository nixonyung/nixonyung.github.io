Commonly known as:

> To fully realize your potential.

But I would rather interpret it as:

> Being able to do whatever you can think of.

Required steps:

1. [Meditation](#meditation) - knowing what you want by acknowledging what your
   own voice says.
2. [Law of Attraction](#law-of-attraction) - hacking your brain by believing you
   can achieve what you want.
3. [Shuhari](..) - taking actions.

> All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence
> that you know.

## Meditation

Commonly known as:

> To clear your mind.

But I would rather interpret it as:

> A training for your mind to observe only your present feelings and thoughts.

- no need to force yourself to have absolutely empty your mind, just remind yourself
  to only observe your present feelings and thoughts
  - our minds requires some deliberate training to do so (you may search "guided meditation")

## Law of Attraction

Commonly known as:

> Positive thoughts attract positive events to your lives.

But I would rather interpret it as:

> To reprogram your subconscious so that it knows how to help you to get what you want.

- have a clear image of who you want to be, then your mind will make you more
  aware of relevant information

  > What you aim at determines what you see.
  >
  > \- [Jordan B. Peterson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9108708-what-you-aim-at-determines-what-you-see)

- note that your subconscious can only understand "positive" thoughts

  - e.g. If you tell yourself "you ain't afraid of ghosts" you will be more
    afraid. To be not afraid you should not think about ghosts at all.

> As you think, so shall you become.
