If you are lost, keep moving forward.<br/>
If you have no way to go, pave your own way.<br/>
If you are not confident enough, remind yourself that you still have someone to protect.<br/>
If you have no one to rely on, "believe in you that believes in yourself".<br/>

However long road has an end.<br/>
Blindly charging forward will only destroy the established peace.<br/>
But when the enemy is too strong and there is no way back,<br/>
we should awaken the "spiral power" and break the unbreakable.<br/>

Befriend former enemies and obtain an indispensable power.<br/>
Transform ancient spirits into knowledge and have it guides the way.<br/>
Slim probabilities only represent the limits of the assumptions.<br/>
Infinite despair only composed of finite tests.<br/>
Allies' sacrifices will break the boundaries for us.<br/>
The spirit of never giving up will let us no longer be confused.<br/>
It's time to show the kids what's possible.<br/>
It's time to show the world who we are.<br/>
