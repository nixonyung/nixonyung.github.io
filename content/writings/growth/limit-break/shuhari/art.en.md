The human mind is composed of feelings and thoughts.<br/>
Beyond the mind is the material world.<br/>
Humans perceive the world through the five senses, triggering feelings and thoughts.<br/>

> Art is an arrangement of stimulations to our five senses.

Examples:

- landscapes

  - to immerse ourselves in true color scenes and lossless audio

- drawing, sculpturing, photography

  - to create a scene

    - triggering our innate responses
      - e.g. hunger
      - e.g. excitement
      - e.g. fear
      - e.g. disgust
    - bringing back memories and triggering emotions

- culinary

  - to enjoy good smell + taste + texture + plating

- dancing

  - to follow the flow of action
    - pace and range of the actions = how intense the feelings are

- music

  - to follow the flow of sound

    - volume and speed of the music = how intense the feelings are
    - resolutions in chord progression = feeling good or bad

- language

  - to trigger trained responses with sounds and symbols
    - to name tangible objects so that we can communicate with each other
    - to name abstract concepts so that we can modularize and compose our thoughts
      - e.g. adjectives, adverbs
      - e.g. logic: to describe chronological relationships that must hold
      - e.g. math: to describe quantitative relationships that must hold
      - e.g. science: to describe chronological and/or quantitative relationships that have always been held

- songs

  - music + lyrics = mood

- movies / stage plays

  - stage setting + soundtracks + props + dialogues + body language = story

- flirting

  - to build a good atmosphere with wordplay + soothing music + perfume +
    appropriate touching + ...

> Poetry is either something that lives like fire inside you -
>
> like music to the musician or Marxism to the communist -
>
> or else it is nothing, an empty, formalized bore around which pedants can
> endlessly drone their notes and explanations.
