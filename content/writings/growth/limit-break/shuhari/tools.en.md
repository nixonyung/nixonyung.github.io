The human mind is composed of feelings and thoughts.<br/>
Beyond the mind is the material world.<br/>
The mind wants the world to work the way the mind does.<br/>

> Tools are what we use to realize our thoughts.

Examples：

- our bodies

  - to have us move in the world
  - to interact with things/tools in the world

- human inventions

  - to apply science in everyday life and solve problems

    - e.g. mechanical systems
      - as an alternative way to interact with things / other tools in the world
    - e.g. electronics
      - to manipulate data
    - e.g. factories
      - to change the states of objects

- art tools

  - e.g. for photography (art form), we may use a digital camera (tool) to create
    a digital file (tool) that can be viewed on a computer (tool) to show what
    we photographed

- companies

  - to make money from money

- societies

  - to reallocate resources via political systems so that as many people as
    possible can survive
  - we all have different definitions of "how to ensure as many people as possible can survive"
    - e.g. Confucianism: everyone has their duties
    - e.g. Elitism: the most capable should take over
    - e.g. Legalism: ruling the country by law
    - e.g. Welfarism: we are all equal
    - e.g. Anarchism: to let people find their paths from absolute freedom

> How have we increased memory, thought, and reasoning?
>
> By the invention of external aids: It is things that make us smart.

We make tools to save time and effort on repetitive work.<br/>
We use tools from our predecessors to save time and effort in making tools.<br/>
Tools persist in the material world, carrying their creators' thoughts.<br/>
But the tools will wear out; the ideas it carries will become obsolete.<br/>
If you don't like something, just try to make it what you want it to be.<br/>

> Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact:
>
> Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no
> smarter than you.
