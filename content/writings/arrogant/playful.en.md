It is said that masking yourself can completely change your personality.<br/>

Then what if I become playful?<br/>
Will I then be able to release my lust?<br/>
To be forgiven for falling for girls easily?<br/>
To hide my boring side?<br/>
To elimilate the unbearable pain from failures?<br/>
To forget the unforgettable memories?<br/>
To fantasize myself saving lonely girls?<br/>
To wipe out the part of me who is easily nervous and overwhelmed,<br/>
and always come up with reasons to be abandoned?<br/>

Perhaps.<br/>
