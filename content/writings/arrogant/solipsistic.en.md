Good times breed corruption.<br/>
The weak assimilate the strong with number advantage.<br/>
But you are still not me.<br/>

Bad times give birth to heroes.<br/>
The strong eliminate the weak with brute force.<br/>
Can you do it?<br/>

The winner takes it all:<br/>
The strong shed blood and tears to define the right way.<br/>
The weak beg for food and humbly survive.<br/>

Why do we always have to sacrifice good people?<br/>

In Utopia, there are only good people and good things.<br/>
I can make use of everything in the world.<br/>

A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.<br/>
A cup of clean water cannot hold a drop of ink.<br/>
Isn't there a saying "the discerning have no friends"?<br/>
It's just that God is mysophobic.<br/>

I am God.<br/>
