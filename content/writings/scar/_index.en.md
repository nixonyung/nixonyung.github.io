The boy likes the girl,<br/>
"You are the only one in my heart."<br/>
The girl pretends to hear nothing.<br/>
"You should be mature."<br/>
The girl wants the boy to empty his heart.<br/>
The boy walks in, alone in the world.<br/>
You gently stitched up the wounds.<br/>
No one can enter my heart.<br/>
