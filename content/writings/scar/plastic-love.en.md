Countless people look at me seductively.<br/>
Why do you like me?<br/>

Is it because it feels right?<br/>
Do you also have the same feeling for anyone you are familiar with? (a.k.a. the Mere-exposure effect)<br/>

You can never love me.<br/>
You just love yourself.<br/>

The love you declare is just people-pleasing;<br/>
baptizing sunk costs as "proof of love";<br/>
and feeling "loved" when people please you in return.<br/>

The relationship you define is just two people, each loving themselves, being together,<br/>
deeming that it is actions that prolong the relationship.<br/>
When there are problems you will only mumble "I have already done a lot",<br/>
instead of finding a way to solve the problems together.<br/>
If you get busy and spend less time in the relationship,<br/>
you will inevitably conclude "There is no passion in the relationship".<br/>

To me you are no different than any woman outside,<br/>
that can be charmed with the correct eye contact and rhythm.<br/>
You are not worthy of me waking up at midnight just to realize it is not yet the day.<br/>
You are not worthy of me worrying when you don't see my messages.<br/>
Your flaws are not something that I want to get used to,<br/>
but making you not a 10 when compared with others.<br/>

What is love?<br/>
We can only find the answer within ourselves.<br/>
Loving someone, just as loving doing something, need not a reason:<br/>
for which it is not our impulse to act that leads to love,<br/>
but it is love that urges us to act.<br/>

Do I really love you?<br/>
For men, it is a simple answer during Kenja Time.<br/>
For women, it is not that straightforward.<br/>
This is why women are slaves of their feelings,<br/>
and so confusing love with desserts, material desires, flattery and intimacy.<br/>

The love from your primitive instincts does not seem to earn my love.<br/>

When you look at me, I want to see me in your eyes.<br/>
